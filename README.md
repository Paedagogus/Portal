If you are reading this, you are probably the customer of this project. And probably for the first time in your life, you can be on both sides, the provider and the customer. 

Let me introduce the project named "Paedagogus".

Around the world, we estimate we have 11.000.000 developers. A lot of developers, but most of them are relaxed on their day to day job and don't do 
much to improve. But there are a lot of them that seek to improve their skills everyday. And one of the ways they are trying to do it, is to search for articles about some technology or some new design pattern or even videos of conferences to learn from the best.

But, can you imagine the quantity of information out there? The billions of posts or millions of videos? Are you sure you're reading the best of the industry?

This project aims to provide a way for you and your colleagues to share links they've read. And the community will be able to vote them to pick the best of the industry on a given topic. You'll be able to search within millions or even billions of posts. Can you imagine that? 

Are you interested in helping us? Please join us.
